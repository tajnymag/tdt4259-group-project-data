## Data groups

### Primary reserves

Shows the amount and pricing of primary reserves in the grid. Also called **F**requency **C**ontrol **R**eserves.

primaryreserves{day,two} should be merged

primaryreservesweek is basically agregated primaryreserves{day,two}

### Secondary reserves

Shows the amount and pricing of secondary reserves in the grid. Also called **F**requency **C**ontrol **R**eserves.

secondaryreserves is similar to primaryreservesweek but for, wait for it, secondary reserves

### RKOM

Shows data about the regulator power market. Each week there's a bidding process where the grid operators bid for the right to regulate the grid. Thus dataset contains information about week + price + hour of the day for MWh of energy in certain area.

Until 2014, Statnett released RKOM data divided into 3 areas. Since 2014, they've released it divided into 5 areas which are agreggated, unfortunately almost randomly, each year differently.

rkom and rkomdata is the same thing, but rkomdata is more is more detailed and starts at 2014

### Power flow

Shows the power flow from and into Norway's power grid.

### Production and consumption

Shows the production and consumption of energy in all Norway.
